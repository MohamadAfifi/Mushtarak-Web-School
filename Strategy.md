# important notes for the contributors 

## the roles

first off we have three main kinds of roles : 

1. Editors : responsible for writing down the sessions.
2. Reviews : responsible for reviewing the sessions and writing the final resuls in the master branch as well as the wiki.
3. Localisers : responsible for localising the sessions into arabic or any other language.

## the contribution strategy

this section is about managing the work (how will we contribute with each others)

1. our collaboration will be mainly on Github,hence all of the work should be commited and pushed to this github repo.
2. there will be a main branch (master) where the REVIEWERS will be adapting the work together.
3. each editor will be creating their own branch to add/edit the content.
4. the base work will be Mon3m's papers and then all of us will be working on enhancing it, developing on it and finally reviewing it before merging it to the master.

5. the localisers will be awaiting for the changes in the master branch, then they will start localizing it.
